The application is a task management tool that helps users organize their daily activities efficiently. It allows users to **view**, **add**, **edit** and **delete** activities from a list using the [DummyJSON API](<(https://dummyjson.com/docs)>). Users can mark activities as completed and filter them by status (pending or completed) or description. The design is **responsive** and provides a pleasant user experience to stay organized and productive.
