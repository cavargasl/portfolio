Create an application for auctioning properties, which must include:

1. Registration and login functionality, with restricted access to different pages for users only, allowing them to auction properties and bid on properties.
2. An internal page listing available properties (for auction).
3. An internal page listing properties the current user is auctioning.
4. An internal page listing properties obtained (through bids).
5. An internal page with a form for auctioning properties.
6. Validations: The owner of a property cannot bid on their own property. The person who starts an auction can end it at any time, and the last bidder will automatically have the property added to their inventory.
7. Optional: The last bidder on a property cannot bid again until another user places a bid on the property.
8. A logout button should be available, redirecting to the login page, and users should not exceed the current funds they have when bidding.
