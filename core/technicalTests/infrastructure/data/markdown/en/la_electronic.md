Create a To-Do list in **React** using the [Cat Fact API](https://catfact.ninja/), which is a series of organized items corresponding to the user's pending tasks. It should include the following features:

1. Allow the user to view a list of pending tasks.
2. Allow the user to add a new task to the list.
3. Allow the user to mark a task as completed.
4. Allow the user to delete a task from the list.
5. Allow the user to edit a task description.
6. Allow filtering of the task list by description text.
7. Allow the user to fill the task list with random cat facts, specifying how many they want to add.
