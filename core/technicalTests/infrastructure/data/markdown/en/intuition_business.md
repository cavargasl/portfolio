Development test using **React** and **Express** where a registration form is created with the fields and design shown in the [PDF](/documents/test_weplot.pdf). The goal is to store all these fields, along with an image, and provide an option for users to log in with the data they assigned. They should be able to view the information they entered in the form. Additionally, an admin role should exist to view registered data, questions, and uploaded images. The admin should have the ability to change questions such as: Favorite Food, Favorite Artist, Favorite Place, and Favorite Color, without affecting the data already stored in the database.
