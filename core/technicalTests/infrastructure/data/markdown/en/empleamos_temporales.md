Develop a website for consuming the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API, considering the **documentation** and **best development practices**. The homepage should display Posts with their corresponding comments in a paginated table. Each post should have a delete button. You should create the necessary forms for publishing and updating a Post. Additionally, implement a notification window (modal) for any of the operations performed.
