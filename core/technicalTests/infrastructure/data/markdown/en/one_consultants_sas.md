1. **DataPersonal**: Contains a form that captures personal data and saves it in a global Redux state.
2. **DataAcademic**: Captures academic data and saves it in Redux.
3. **Summary**: Contains a summary of the data captured in the previous components, retrieving the information from the global state for later submission to the database.
4. **TableRegister**: Contains a list of all records in the database.
