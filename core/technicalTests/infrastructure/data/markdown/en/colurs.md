Develop a 'to-do list' inspired by the 'Dona mobile composer interactions' design by [@JakubAntalik](https://dribbble.com/shots/14568765-Dona-mobile-composer-interactions), application using **React Native**, where the user can add, mark as completed, or delete items from the list, storing data locally on the device and using React Hooks for state management. The app should include simple animations when adding, marking, or deleting items, and animation libraries like react-native-reanimated are allowed. The design should be minimalist, with an input field for new tasks and a list of items.
