Create a **React** web application that features an external authentication and utilizes data from the [Dummy API](https://dummyapi.io/). On the homepage, **list Posts**, each of which should display the user's photo and name who created the post, the post's image and text, post tags, number of likes and comments. Clicking on a post should open a modal displaying all comments related to that post. Another modal should show detailed information about the user who created the post. Users should be able to **filter** posts by tags. The authenticated user's information should be displayed at the header page.
